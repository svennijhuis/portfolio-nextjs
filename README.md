# Sven Nijhuis portfolio

Welcome to the roadmap for my portfolio website! As I continue to develop and improve this site, I have identified a few key areas that I would like to focus on in the near future. This roadmap outlines my plans to enhance the functionality and user experience of my website.

First and foremost, I plan to improve the types in my TypeScript code to ensure greater accuracy and reliability. By doing so, I aim to make my codebase more maintainable and scalable.

Additionally, I plan to integrate my website with Supabase, a platform that offers a variety of backend services such as authentication and database management. This will allow me to add more advanced features to my website while also simplifying the development process.

Finally, I plan to add a bucket for images to my website. This will enable me to store and display images more efficiently and effectively, improving the overall visual experience for visitors.

I am excited to embark on these improvements and look forward to sharing my progress with you. Thank you for your interest in my portfolio website!
